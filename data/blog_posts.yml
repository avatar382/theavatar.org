      class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="c9g7g-0-0">It’s pretty amazing to me how
      spending money with a card feels so different from cash. I get stingy with cash,
      especially small amounts — but past a certain amount, cash becomes a ‘wad’ and
      looses meaning. I had this experience when buying a Craigslist car, I had 5
      G’s in my pocket. It would have felt the same to carry $700 or $10,000… it’s
      just a big roll of paper. </div></div><div data-block="true" data-editor="6t6km"

      _1mj" data-offset-key="9d69e-0-0">With cards, it’s a (seemingly) bottomless
      pit of swipe swipe swipe. I’m less aware of the amounts involved. There’s no
      feedback from the process besides the receipt you get back, and the numbers
      on the receipt are kind of small. Besides, how can you tell how much you have
      left? </div></div><div data-block="true" data-editor="6t6km" data-offset-key="5h9s7-0-0"><div

      data-editor="6t6km" data-offset-key="ces8r-0-0"><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="ces8r-0-0">That’s
      easy with cash - you give someone a twenty, and you get $1.62 back. The experience
      of getting back change is so dramatic compared to seeing $18.38 on a register
      and just swiping your card and getting on with it.</div></div><div data-block="true"

      large amounts of money, and cash is great for managing small amounts. Of course,
      small amounts of money turns to large amounts over time!</div></div><div data-block="true"

      _1mj" data-offset-key="9edgu-0-0">I’ve been tracking all my spending to the
      penny for several years now. I’m a big fan of the YNAB (google it) budgeting
      methodology. The biggest benefit to me has been forcing me to categorize every
      single expense. Yesterday, I went to Target and bought office supplies, paper
      towels, Armor All car wipes, pita chips, and kombucha. Out of sheer habit, I
      dutifully split the whole transaction into parts to match my budget line items
      — Household, Groceries, Treats, and Car Maintenance. Yay! I actually really
      enjoy the splitting, I’m a huge data nerd and doing this feels productive.</div></div><div

      all this work doesn’t really help me control my spending! The Treats line item
      in my budget exploded in red for the last 3 weeks. I half-blame Krishna Lunch
      for not serving during break week. I got into the habit of going out for lunch
      and it turned into a 3 week addiction where my per day lunch expenses exploded
      from $6-7 to over $16! Shit!</div></div><div data-block="true" data-editor="6t6km"

      I bought a binder and put 8 clear pockets in it. The first pocket is labeled
      “This Month”, and the other 7 are “Monday - Sunday”, one for each day of the
      week.</div></div><div data-block="true" data-editor="6t6km" data-offset-key="9euiu-0-0"><div

      week I’ll split it amount the days. Right now, I have $6 in my wallet, $10 in
      my Monday folder, a $20 in the Tuesday folder, and another $20 in the Thursday
      folder. Next Saturday, I’ll replenish the folders for the week.</div></div><div

      amounts I chose to give myself are about 10% lower than my average spending
      for the past 5 months. So I’m challenging myself to spend a little less, but
      not by much. I feel like I can do this. The real challenge is giving up the
      swipe habit. I know I’m going to face that moment where I’m out of cash and
      craving Karma Cream, but the only money available to me is marked “Thursday”
      and it’s only Monday. </div></div><div data-block="true" data-editor="6t6km"

    title: Political Rant
    content: <p></p><p>With all the election related political stuff going on, I've
      been thinking about what my responsibilities are as a citizen to participate
      in the political process.</p><p>I’m feeling some helplessness about it — It
      seems inevitable that either Clinton or Trump will be President — and I do not
      support either of them. But deeper than that, I’m usually scared to even bring
      up politics in my daily life.</p><p>I’m blessed to have lots of space in my
      life for listening and sharing — and yet it rarely feels appropriate or safe
      to talk about politics. I feel like the potential for emotional charge with
      politics is so large, it’s usually not worth bringing up. I’m dissatisfied with
      this.</p><div class="text_exposed_show"><p>I do occasionally have political
      discussions with close friends. Since I associate mostly with like-minded people,
      it feels a little like an echo chamber sometimes. I’d like to debate a little,
      hear different opinions, and have my ideas and beliefs tested.</p><p>I’ve thought
      about engaging online, but it’s hard to really connect with others that way.
      I don’t think I’ve ever changed my mind on a major political position because
      of an online comment or Facebook post. It seems clear - person-to-person, with
      respect and empathy, is the most productive way to have political discussions.
      I’m setting an intention to open up a little and bring these thoughts and issues
      up with anyone interested that I interact with face to face, even if it feels
      risky.</p></div><p></p>
